	F.L.A.G Forensic and Log Analysis GUI
	    http://pyflag.sourceforge.net

This application is designed to assist IT security professionals with
analysing log files, tcpdump files and hard disk images for forensic
evidence. 

PyFlag is designed to run on Linux and has been tested on recent
versions of Redhat/Fedora and Debian (Stable/Testing). It performs
data analyis using a mysql database. It is written in python and
should be portable to other unix-like systems.

Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.
